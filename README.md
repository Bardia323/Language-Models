# Language-Models
Examples of semi-predictable paragraphs and texts to teach your Transformer Models. All examples below are AI generated and can be used to generate more. Since [Language models are one-shot learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09679). Most of these were tested on GPT-3, but there's no reason other well-trained language models cannot do the same.

## Pitch Maker. For your next big thing.
```
Pitch: artificial intelligence platform
The PC industry is dying. It's been dying since the early 90â€²s, but now it's really dead. There are two main reasons why: 1) The Internet changed everything, 2) People stopped caring about being cool and started wanting to be productive. AI is going to change everything again. In fact, it already has. Google's DeepMind beat all the world champions at Go (a board game). They used machine learning to play the game better than humans could. It was amazing! But what if you could use AI to improve your life? You could build a computer that could learn from experience and improve itself. That's what we're doing with UBIK. We want to create machines that can think like humans, not just like computers. We want to create the first true AI.
On the way to achieving that, we're creating a platform that allows other companies to build their own AI technology in an easy-to-use form. By doing so we hope to accelerate innovation in the world. For example, in healthcare alone we could discover cures for diseases using AI to analyze data that humans simply can't process. In customer service we could create an AI rep that never gets tired or frustrated and is able yet knowledgeable. The possibilities are endless!
Our brand is about intelligence, innovation, and optimism. We want to bring back the space-race era of the 50's and 60's when everything was possible and nothing was impossible. We want to be the company that leads humanity to the next frontier, because we believe that there is no limit to what one can achieve, and that no matter how far away something may seem, it will eventually come to us. If anything is truly limitless, it's human potential.

## Goals? SMART Goals! (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound)
```
Goal: Exercise, pullups
SMART Goal: I want to be able to do 2 consecutive pull-ups by the end of the year by practicing pull-ups at the gym 3 times per week.

## Idea Generator. Brainstorm infinite ideas.
```
Tags: App, Location Based Services, GPS Tracking
Idea: A location-based service that allows you to know when your car is going to be at a particular place and what time.

Tags: manufacturing, supply chain, efficiency
Idea: A system which allows manufacturers to "opt in" and have their products' serial numbers registered. If a defective item harms someone, the manufacturer is notified and can provide a replacement part with the same serial number. This increases brand visibility and reputation, while protecting manufacturers from brand harm when an item under a different brand name causes injury. (Eg. A chair's arm breaks and smashes someone's skull, killing them. The chair's arm is found to have been made by Company A, who notifys Company Z of the problem and provides them with a replacement part).

by experience, general principles, and design techniques. In fact, the heuristic nature of the software design process is what makes it an exciting creative activity.

 The quality attributes that constitute the dimensions of the design space also correspond to the general goals of design.
